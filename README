postman_requests_mock
=====================

A small library to mock requests_ with the help of Postman_.

The use case workflow is to use Postman to test a service making few
requests, exporting the collection and using it in some test.

Ex:

.. code:: python

   >>> import requests
   >>> from postman_requests_mock import (
   ...     PostmanCollectionV21, requests_mock)
   >>> collection = PostmanCollectionV21.from_file('test/basic.json')
   >>> mock = requests_mock(collection)
   >>> with mock:
   ...     resp = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/ip')
   >>> resp.json()
   {'origin': '1.1.1.1'}

At the moment the library matche only the HTTP method, the URL and the
requests' headers. Match against the body is not supported. This
should not be an issue in the most of cases.
